Dear Dr. _parameter1_,
<p>
You are now an official participant in SPIRE. 
</p>

<p>
Your first SPIRE Entry will be started on _parameter2_. However, you can login now and go through the pages or provide demographics information.
</p>
<p>
The steps you need to take are as follows:<br />
1. One time demographics data input.<br />
2. Monthly SPIRE survey answers.
</p>
<p>
If you were late for a monthly SPIRE survey entry, then there will be another chance for you to enter the data through the top menu called 'SPIRE Previous Entry'.
 During the SPIRE study, you can withdraw or defer your participation status and then participate again through the top menu called 'Participation'. Otherwise you can email us to change your participation status.
</p>

<p>
Your login information is as follows:
<ul>
<li>LoginID: _parameter3_</li>
<li>Password: _parameter4_</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul><li><a href='_parameter5_'>Go to SPIRE to login</a></ul>
</p>

<p>
If you have a difficulty in logging into the SPIRE web application or for more information, please email to
