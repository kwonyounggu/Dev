								<h3><span style="color: #519DC7;">CALIPER: Urgent Need for a New Database of Normal Values in Healthy Children</span></h3>
									<p>The care of patients at SickKids is critically dependent on reliable and accurate laboratory tests. Correct interpretation of these tests<br>
									   relies on availability of normal values (a range of blood test results obtained from a group of healthy children to determine what is<br>
									   normal when a child is screened for a disease). By establishing accurate and reliable normal values from a healthy but diverse<br>
									   Canadian paediatric population, clinicians and laboratory scientists will be better positioned to accurately diagnose children<br>
									   presenting with medical concerns.</p>
									<p>Clinical Laboratories at SickKids is coordinating a nation-wide initiative to establish a comprehensive database of normal test<br>
									   values in children. This project, named CALIPER, is a collaborative research project of children’s hospitals across Canada.<br>
									   The project is in response to critical gaps that currently exist in paediatric normal values that can hinder interpretation of laboratory<br>
									   tests. This in turn can lead to misdiagnosis of childhood disease. It is therefore of utmost urgency that a new database be<br>
									   established for healthy children.</p>

								<h3><span style="color: #519DC7;">CALIPER: A Project of the Paediatric Focus Group of the CSCC</span></h3>
									<p>A Canadian team of investigators have assembled to lead the establishment of a reliable database<br>across the country. This national research initiative, working under the name of Canadian Laboratory<br>Initiative on Paediatric Reference Interval database (CALIPER database), is a key project of the<br>Paediatric Focus Group of the CSCC (Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists). The project has been<br>endorsed by the CSCC and the Research Ethics Board at several Canadian hospitals.
