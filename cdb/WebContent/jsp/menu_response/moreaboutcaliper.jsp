								<h3><span style="color: #3973AC;">CALIPER: Urgent Need for a New Database of Normal Values in Healthy Children</span></h3>
									<p>The care of patients at pediatric health center is critically dependent on reliable and accurate laboratory tests. Correct interpretation of these tests
									   relies on availability of normal values (a range of blood test results obtained from a group of healthy children to determine what is
									   normal when a child is screened for a disease). By establishing accurate and reliable normal values from a healthy but diverse
									   Canadian paediatric population, clinicians and laboratory scientists will be better positioned to accurately diagnose children
									   presenting with medical concerns.</p>

								<h3><span style="color: #3973AC;">What are reference intervals? Why pediatric reference intervals?</span></h3>
									<p>Reference intervals are a range of normal values for a particular blood test obtained from a large group of healthy individuals. Physicians use reference intervals in everyday practice to interpret their patient's laboratory test results. </p>
									<p>The range of normal values may not be the same for children and adults. As a result, adult reference intervals are rarely applicable to children. Also, as children grow and develop, test results may change with age as part of the normal process. Similarly, male and female children or children of different ethnic groups may have different range of normal values at different ages. As a result, reference intervals must be adequate for age, sex, and potentially ethnic group when a child is investigated for a disease.</p>
									<p>The reference intervals established by CALIPER aims to represent Canada's healthy children and youth, multiethnic, males and females, from birth to 18 years old. </p>
								<h3><span style="color: #3973AC;">Why CALIPER?</span></h3>
									<p>The availability of accurate reference intervals in children is very important when a child with medical concerns is screened for a disease. Unfortunately, there are huge gaps in the intervals that physicians have available to them and this makes the interpretation of blood tests more difficult and increases the risk of misdiagnosis. Successful implementation of the CALIPER project will fill these gaps and directly contribute to improved pediatric healthcare.</p>
								<h3><span style="color: #3973AC;">Study Population</span></h3>
									<p>Healthy children across Canada are recruited for participation in the CALIPER project. The CALIPER study population includes male and female children ages from birth to 18 years of different ethnic groups in Canada. </p>	
									<p>Sample collection is periodically performed in various locations, depending on child’s age. Participating families are invited to regional pediatric hospitals or private clinical laboratory centres, such as participating Gamma-Dynacare test centres. In addition, sample collections are organized in schools, daycare centreers, community centres, and First Nation communities. Small blood samples are collected and then used for a number of important blood tests. The results of the blood tests are then analyzed statistically to establish a range of normal values for a particular test for specific age, sex, and ethnic group. </p>
									<p>All results collected from participants are anonymized. Personal information remains strictly confidential. The anonymized results of the study are made available on the CALIPER website to allow for open worldwide access. The data are also published in reputable international journals. This wide dissemination of the results is aimed at their use in children hospitals across Canada and worldwide, as well as for purposes of public education.</p>

								<p>All results will be anonymized. Personal information will remain strictly confidential.</p>
								<p>The anonymized results of the study will be made available on the CALIPER website to allow for open worldwide access. The data will also be published in reputable international journals. This wide dissemination of the results is aimed to help with their use in children hospitals across Canada and worldwide, as well as for purposes of public education.</p>
								<p>The CALIPER project has been in operation since 2006. The project has established or is in the process of establishing reference intervals for a large number of blood tests commonly performed in the clinical laboratory. The reference intervals provided for these blood tests are specific for a child’s age and sex and also for several ethnic groups.</p>
								<p>The CALIPER project is an ongoing project. Determining of reference intervals for a wider selection of blood tests are in development. Currently, reference intervals are provided specific for age, sex, and several ethnic groups, where this is necessary. As more data becomes available, reference intervals may also be established for additional ethnic groups. Specific reference intervals may also be provided according to child’s height, weight or developmental stage.</p>
