								<h3><span style="color: #3973AC;">CALIPER: Urgent Need for a New Database of Normal Values in Healthy Children</span></h3>
									<p>The care of patients at pediatric health centers is critically dependent on reliable and accurate laboratory tests. Correct interpretation of these tests
									   relies on availability of normal values (a range of blood test results obtained from a group of healthy children to determine what is
									   normal when a child is screened for a disease). By establishing accurate and reliable normal values from a healthy but diverse
									   Canadian paediatric sample population, clinicians and laboratory scientists will be better positioned to accurately diagnose children
									   with medical concerns.</p>

								<h3><span style="color: #3973AC;">What are reference intervals? Why pediatric reference intervals?</span></h3>
									<p>Reference intervals are a range of normal values for a particular blood test obtained from a large group of healthy individuals. Physicians use reference intervals in everyday practice to interpret their patient's laboratory test results. </p>
									<p>The range of normal values may not be the same for children and adults. As a result, adult reference intervals are rarely applicable to children. Also, as children grow and develop, test results may change with age as part of the development process. Similarly, male and female children or children of different ethnic groups may have different ranges of normal values at different ages. As a result, reference intervals must be established based on age, sex, and potentially ethnic group.</p>
									<p>The reference intervals established by CALIPER are aimed to represent Canada's healthy children and youth - multiethnic males and females from birth to 18 years of age. </p>
								<h3><span style="color: #3973AC;">Why CALIPER?</span></h3>
									<p>The availability of accurate reference intervals for children is very important when a child with medical concerns is screened for a disease. Unfortunately, there are huge gaps in the intervals available to physicians physicians have available to them and this makes the interpretation of blood tests more difficult and increases the risk of misdiagnosis. Successful implementation of the CALIPER project will fill these gaps and directly contribute to improved pediatric healthcare.</p>
								<h3><span style="color: #3973AC;">Study Population</span></h3>
									<p>Healthy children across Canada are recruited for participation in the CALIPER project. The CALIPER study population will include both males and females of six age groups as listed below:
									
									<ul><li>Birth – 30 days</li>
										<li>1 month - 12 months</li>
										<li>1 - 5 years</li>
										<li>6 - 10 years</li>
										<li>11 - 14 years</li>
										<li>15 - 18 years</li>
									</ul></p>	
									<p>Sample collection is performed in numerous locations. Participating families are invited to regional pediatric hospitals or private clinical laboratory centres such as participating Gamma-Dynacare test centres to have their child donate blood. Sample collection clinics are also organized in schools, daycare centres, community centres and community centres. Small blood samples are collected and various common blood tests are performed on them. The results of the blood tests are then analyzed statistically to establish a range of normal values for each test that are specific to age, sex, and ethnic group. </p>
									<p>All personal information collected from participants remains strictly confidential. The results of the study are made available on the CALIPER website to allow {for} open worldwide access. The data are also published in reputable international journals. The results are made publically available to allow their use in children’s hospitals across Canada and worldwide.</p>

								</td></tr></table><h3><span style="color: #3973AC;">Benefits of CALIPER</span></h3>
									<p>The major benefit of this project is that it will allow physicians to more accurately interpret children’s test results by comparing patient results to the results obtained from healthy children. This will help them more quickly determine whether or not a child has abnormal levels of a certain blood component and determine the treatment a sick child may need.</p>
									<p>A database of normal values will also prevent misdiagnosis as it will give doctors a more objective means of interpreting results than their personal experience. </p>
									<p>In addition to the benefit of helping sick children across the country and the world, participants are rewarded with $10, 2 community service hours, and the choice between a teddy bear, T-shirt or story book as a thank you for helping. As the participant or any child among their friends or family could get sick at any time, they could personally benefit directly from the results obtained by this study.</p>

								<h3><span style="color: #3973AC;">Results</span></h3>
								<p>The CALIPER project has been in operation since 2006. The project has established reference intervals for over 60 blood tests commonly performed in the clinical laboratory, and is in the process of establishing many more.</p>
